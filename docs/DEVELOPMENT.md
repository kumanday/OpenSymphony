# Development Guide

This document is for contributors working on OpenSymphony itself. For user
setup and operator flows, start with the [README](../README.md) and the docs
linked there.

If you are developing OpenSymphony itself, clone the repository and install from the checkout instead:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kumanday/OpenSymphony.git && cd OpenSymphony
cargo install --path .
```

## Repository structure

```

Only the repository-root `Cargo.toml` is a package manifest. The
`crates/opensymphony-*` directories are internal subsystem module trees that
compile into the one public `opensymphony` package.

## Design summary

OpenSymphony is the Rust implementation of the Symphony orchestration model.

Key choices:

- Rust owns orchestration, retries, workspace lifecycle, and tracker
  reconciliation
- OpenHands is the execution substrate
- Linear reads happen through the internal `opensymphony_linear` module
- agent-side Linear writes use the repo-local GraphQL helper assets copied by
  `opensymphony init`
- FrankenTUI is optional and must not affect correctness

## Milestones

### M1 Foundation and contracts

Workspace bootstrap, workflow/config loading, domain model, state machine.

### M2 OpenHands runtime adapter

Local server supervisor, REST client, WebSocket stream, session runner.

### M3 Symphony orchestration core

Workspace lifecycle, Linear adapter, scheduler, GraphQL-backed repo harness.

### M4 Operator UX and repo harness

Control plane, FrankenTUI, generated issue context artifacts.

### M5 Validation and local packaging

Fake server, live tests, doctor command, packaging.

## Required checks

```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test
```

## Useful commands

```bash
# Format and lint
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings

# Full tests
cargo test

# CLI-focused checks
cargo test --test init
cargo test --test help

# Doctor
cargo run -- doctor --config examples/configs/local-dev.yaml

# Install and smoke-test
cargo install --path . --locked
./scripts/smoke_local.sh
```

## Template ownership

`opensymphony init` bootstraps target repositories from
`OpenSymphony-template`.

Important rule:

- copy `.agents/skills/` recursively, not file-by-file, so helper scripts,
  query assets, and reference docs survive intact
- keep `opensymphony update` aligned with the same recursive copy rule so
  existing target repos can refresh the template-managed skill tree without
  rerunning the full bootstrap flow

When you change shared target-repo assets, update the template first and then
make sure the `init` and `update` flows still copy the full tree.

## Linear development rules

- keep orchestrator-side Linear logic inside the `opensymphony_linear` module tree
- keep agent-side Linear usage in the template-owned `.agents/skills/linear/`
  tree
- prefer checked-in GraphQL query files over inline ad hoc mutations
- do not reintroduce a separate bridge layer for agent-side Linear writes

## Versioning

OpenSymphony `1.0.0` is the compatibility boundary for the GraphQL-only Linear
rewrite.

Breaking changes in this line include:

- removal of the old workflow-owned Linear bridge configuration
- removal of the bridge CLI entrypoint
- provider-agnostic AI review configuration via `AI_REVIEW_API_KEY`
